This is just a sample for you to understand Ignareo. With these codes you can learn how to run concurrent sessions with `gevent`, how to design your codes in a clear manner, and how to play with `AdvancedHTMLParser`. 

**DO NOT ACTUALLY RUN THE CODES HERE! 禁止运行这里的代码！**

This training does not account for real ordering online. For real purchasing, you might prefer to launch a very large number of concurrent sessions and fill in you information into any session that has grabbed a valid order. You can use generators (yield customer_info) to make it.
