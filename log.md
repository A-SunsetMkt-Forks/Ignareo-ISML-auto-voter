Sep. 1st, 2019: Thank Chtholly and ISML operators! isml.moe/voting is responding quite briskly today!  
Aug. 30th, 2019: I've improved IGN. The new file name is IgnaleoG.py. Currently I'm not in the mood of publishing the enhanced Carillon or using any type for spamming.  
By the way, Maglorは不幸だ~  
  
Aug. 29th, 2019: Please stop DDOS!  
Aug. 28th, 2019: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?!

ISML operators shall understand that cloudflare does not provide any protection against IGN, though my aiocfscrape hasn't been updated for the latest IUAM firewall.  
And, stop spamming billions! You'll find it meaningless sonner or later.  
Achtung! IGN can burn 180,000 proxies in an hour(50 proxies per second), at ease!
  
Aug. 10th, 2019: ISML is being DDOS attacked at noontime. Hatred is burning.  

Aug. 7th, 2019: I'll not immediately update IGN for the necklace round.  
Aug. 5th, 2019: Hope a peaceful Necklace round (though that's almost impossible)  
  
Aug. 4th, 2019: Still I thank all that contributed for Ch, Ne and Wi.  
  
Aug. 2nd, 2019: 我对事不对人地问一句：某几家大厨你们对轰得爽吗？

July 12nd, 2019: **It's quite intelligible that some of you do not believe the enormous scale of auto voting, or you may suspect the performance of my program. That's why I realease:**  
**我知道有的人不相信萌战刷票有多恐怖，或者不相信我的程序投票的速度，所以又发射了这个供吃瓜群众参考：**

for your reference. As far as I know, the total number of votes in 24 hours should be at least hundreds of thousands, or millions. The maximum number is quite limited by the hardware of ISML, instead of voting programs.
