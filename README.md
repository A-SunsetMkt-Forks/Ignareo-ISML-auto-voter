Jan. 5th, 2020:  
It's relatively wise of ISML operators giving the honors randomly or according to their appetite, with few alternatives available, before they can design a system preventing vote-spamming effectively.  
The reason of all the problems is the lack of chance. However much efforts paid, only the few can acquire acknowledgement. So saimoes have to be involutional(内卷的) competitions, and become overly fierce sooner or later. Involution not only impedes evolution but also devastates existing rules after all, because in fact people are overly suffering without being paid off.  
As involution develops, surely there would be someone who breaks all the rules. I'm just a progressive one, launching the space warships a bit earlier than the call of Historia. Involution is not sustainable. More opportunities and evolution have to be created. If you (whether voter or operator) persist on involution, please firstly overtake me with technical force.  
We have spent too much in deciding the winning character. However, as far as I know, few participants have mastered the necessary programming skills. People have not become more able and productive till now. Neither did they love their waifus much more because of fierce saimoe matches. Bad codes of clients and servers are made again and again.  
Saimoes are, in the final analysis, just websites with no more than javascript and html. Voters and operators are both responsible for the evolution instead of involution. Let's consider something more interesting, or at least take effective measures to stop involution. Please make better programs and events. Please evolve our happiness and productivity.  
  
By the way, I think current bilibili voting programs are too slow to qualify. I have seen only 70 votes per second. These codes will become jokes when they face 60,000 requests per second handled by one ordinary machine.

Welcome to the shop *Some Chthollic leprechaun warehouse* (Not an official translation) on taobao!  
  
Nov. 18th, 2019: **Time for academic punk!**  
Quite a few have requested the **CNN training codes**. I'm too exhausted to write instructions, so help yourself! The main training dataset is currently not available. The structure of the neural network can be found [here](https://github.com/Hecate2/ISML_auto_voter/blob/master/CNN_training/Classifier.png)  
Minimum requirement of GPU: one GTX1080ti  
Minimum requirement of training set: 3,000 to 10,000 effective samples. One *sample* refers to one full captcha image with 8 letters or digits.  
Many thanks to all who sacrificed for Chtholly and something named "justice".  
验证码系统为了便于训练、部署、计算，降低硬件门槛，而牺牲了极限性能。谨代表珂朵莉和威廉练剑所发挥的最低水平！ 
The CAPTCHA system sacrifices its peek efficiency in order to lower the difficulty of training and deploying, as well as the minimum required hardware. This is just to represent the lowest achievement of Chtholly's practice with Willem!
It is possible to improve the anti-captcha system with scene text recognition, but at a heavy price of time and hardware.  
  
Nov 14th: 1st anniversary for the Scrapy asynchronous prototype.   
Nov 9th: IgnareoG updated. Nobody had paid any price for using IgnareoG before it was published.  
  
Nov 1st: SukaMoka 08 is really enjoyable! But as far as I know, not every reader wants Chtholly to come to life again.  
  
Oct. 12th, 2019: *Ignareo.py* will be **renamed** as ***IgnareoA.py***. **The name *Ignareo* now refers to the whole series of programs (the whole project)**

## Brief introduction for ISML voters:  
Screaming high concurrency! Light weight Convolutional Neural Network! Against captcha within 0.06 seconds per image on CPU! 
Easy for distributed deployment!  
  
The structure of IGN can be applied for any saimoe voting and even more in principle (I'm using IgnareoA to monitor IoT devices). Using IGN for other purposes is also welcomed. **Feel free to raise** ***Issues*** **including "我永远喜欢珂朵莉", "I love Chtholly forever", "私はいつまでもクトリが好きです", and even more!** （请扭曲的珂学家不要一夜之间刷两千条……）  
However, **BE CAREFUL in case your operations may result in a CC attack!** (I've killed an SQL service imprudently with IGN...)  
  
## Why Ignareo instead of Scrapy?  
I have already developed an auto voter in 2018, using Scrapy. Scrapy is truly a great framework.  
  
The first reason why I aborted Scrapy is that it can cause critical trouble when you need a non-blocking pause between two requests. It seems you have to set the pause before receiving the response of the first request (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36984696/scrapy-non-blocking-pause). Consequently it becomes difficult to control the interval of requests.  

Secondly, Scrapy probably does not maintain synced(connected?) with the server. It starts another TCP connection with new SYN for every new request. This characteristic not only leads to redundant SYN flow, but also makes it easier for the website to detect the spider. For example, Scrapy may start a new TCP connection sending a POST request. Real browsers never do so!  

Last but not least, the codes for a Scrapy spide, crammed in a single class and ran in a single process, can be chaotic and frustrating to understand and maintain.  

It's very difficult to predict or control the detailed behavior of Scrapy, because it is such a great framework, making most decisions for you, hiding most of its source codes. This is good in many cases, but when you execute your personalized demands and decisions, you have to fight the framework.  
  
Destroyer Ignareo, as a reinvented wheel, is re-designed for the future. With only hundreds of lines of codes in the core, she allows you to define your own work flow, and understand everything about her. Now you can focus more on data parsing and dependency.  
  
**Ignareo has been fully tested in real combats.** Just trust her as your reliable partner!   
  
## How to use:  
In DestroyerIGN, start **captchaServer.py**, and then **IgnareoG.py**. 
Finally, provide Destroyer Ignareo with ammunition (proxy ips) by starting **Ammunition.py**.  
**IGN does not open fire until you run Ammunition.py at last!**  
**IgnareoA is not fully reliable** when thousands of concurrent connections have to be handled in a single process, especially on Windows. But IgnareoA saves a little bit of memory and CPU than IgnareoG.  
  
## Tutorial for civil users  
```gevent.spawn(a_function_with_socket_operations, param, param, parameters…)```  
```gevent.joinall(greenlets_spawned_by_gevent)```  
~~and that's all you need!~~  
Reconstructing Ignareo requires an understanding of its structure. I'm sorry but you may have to read the source code of IgnareoG. Feel free to copy any code to shape your components.  
  
I have been looking for methods of further integration, but integration sacrifices transparency and simplicity. I need ideas to make Ignareo easier to use.  
  
##  I/O engines:  
IgnareoG uses `gevent` making your `socket` asynchronous. It means you can feed gevent with multi-thread web spider codes (typically `requests`) and enjoy asynchronous performance. In principle you can even connect to databases asynchronously. The event loop of gevent on different platforms is documented at http://www.gevent.org/loop_impls.html. According to the page, Windows users now have libuv!  
  
IgnareoA uses the classical Python library `asyncio`. The codes in IgnareoA have to be literally asynchronous with `async def`, `ensure_future`, `await` and  `add_callback`.  
  
You may also have a try with ```trio``` or ```httpx```. Help yourself and happy coding!  
  
## Structure:  
IGN for ISML is fabricated with 3 cascades:  
data producer -> main network I/O -> servers for computation intensive tasks  
Every later cascade is an http server for the previous one. Enjoy elastic web spiders deployed in microservices!  
  
The data producer collects, neatens and gives the necessary information to start new I/O tasks. 
The captcha server receives POST from the main I/O, and recognizes the letters and digits in the captcha image. In other words they undertake all the computation-intensive jobs.  
This paradigm provides an example involving all kinds of I/O and computation. All the processes can be easily distrubuted on different machines.  
**Hopefully Ignareo serves just as a concept** of high performance I/O engine, rather than a heavy framework. **I tried to make no decision for you**, except for performance and convenience of transplanting your other web spiders.  
  
Note that you can write all kinds of blocking codes in IgnareoG. `gevent` even turns `time.sleep()` into non-blocking pause. That means you can boast high performance automatically. But non-socket time-consuming codes (computation or long-playing HDD I/O) should be transfered to other processes.  
  
To control the network I/O process, write your own codes in **Voter.py**.  
To deploy multiple processes of servers, change **portList** in Ammunition.py, IgnareoA.py and captchaServer.py.  
To change which characters to vote for, modify **charaSelector.py**.  
To tackle Cloudflare IUAM firewall (Checking your browser before…) with IgnareoA, try to extract the JavaScript carefully, using **aiocfscrape.py**. The original version offered by https://github.com/pavlodvornikov/aiocfscrape have been disabled since Cloudflare changes the firewall very often. You may refer to all the resources from Github to bypass the firewall.  
  
## Accessories: 
**ISMLnextGen**, which contains some prototypes and basic code blocks, is the lab for the development of IGN.

<font color=DodgerBlue>Shino Asada</font>,  
who always charge my will to conquer all the difficulties.  
  
Thanks to all that support Ignareo, including but not limited to the contributers of all the magnificent open codes utilized by Ignareo. 
  
Thanks to my supporting group, which invested huge funds to give birth to the previous generations of auto voter programs.
Thanks for their trust and cultivation on me.  
  
Thanks to ISML, as well as other saimoe platforms, 
which gives me the opportunity and an arena to practice web spiders and other technologies. 
Perhaps saimoe tournamens in the future should give up deciding who is the most moe character, and focus more on training programmers.  

Thanks to some of my opponents in saimoe, who developed brilliant programs to inspire and spur on me.  
  
Thanks to all the ***Chthollists*** who love Chtholly and SukaSuka.  
  
## How do I build Ignareo?  
By reading documents of many (possibly) useful libraries!  
  
## Tips! What if ISML responds very slowly?  
First, please allow me to ascribe the reason dogmatically to spammers using pristine selenium wildly.  
By running a miniature version of stress test involving a mixture of selenium, multi-thread spamming programs and IGN, I would like to give the following suggestion:
> **STOP USING IGN** when ISML is really slow. If you persist reloading IGN with ammunition very quickly, it can be extremely difficult for everyone (both humans and programs) to submit vote. **Neither bots nor humans will be able to submit**! Therefore,  ISML would receive very few votes for hours, until someone quit.  
  
**But why?**  
Well, selenium and multi-thread web spiders has a ***limited*** number of "**workers**" (the word may refer to either processes or threads), but the number of workers of IGN is ***almost unlimited***.  
usually kept in the program, waiting. Exerting pressure on a server with limited "workers" can hardly lead to a Denial of Service, because they do not start new spamming attempts when all the workers have to wait. So most of the workers can receive their responses sooner or later. But IGN doesn't care about slow responses and keep raising more attempts. With the passage of time (perhaps within only a few minutes in actual battles), it is likely that IGN would own the absolute major portion of unresponded requests, which will be far more than what ISML can handle. The increase of unresponded requests, however, gives even more positive feedback to generating unhandled spamming attempts, since IGN does not care about the unresponded ones! Only the timeout and the failure of proxies can stop IGN from holding more requests.  
> And do not assume yourself as the undisputed winner when you take up all the hardware resources of ISML with your ancient spamming programs. You can't exclude IGN at all, but you rile everyone.  
  
## Tips! Important for the most wealthy voters!
As the saying goes: *Victorque has hundreds of thousands of bilibili accounts*.  
**Before you challenge a rich supporting group, you should always consider such a probable fact: though IGN can support 2500 to 5000 voters on your computer, your opponent has hundreds of machines, each can run 25 to 50 selenium browsers. Meanwhile, you can't afford the cost for proxies.**   
  
0. Spamming **TOO MANY** votes is usually meaningless, except for burning your own $dollars, making difficulties for ISML operaters, and delaying the following matches.  
1. Think before you cast billions of votes in a few minutes. If you really would like to spam, spread your votes to the whole 24 hours. Quick spamming are sure to be recognized by ISML operators.  
2. Think twice if you want to challenge any character. You should disguise yourself very well, and you know you may get revenged.  
3. ~~Think three times if you want to vote billions against the wish of ISML operators.~~ The justical operators have the right to ignore your votes without certain proof!  
4. Think four times if you want to challenge some super-rich supporting groups. The cost for employing programmers is just a piece of cake for them, since they have hundreds of thousands of budget for all kinds of saimoe platforms! Well, that is not at all a large sum of money if everyone burns cash with IGN, but you should always assume that they have infinite wealth.
5. Think five times before you launch IGN, because IGN drains everyone's life and wealth. You are a human, not a leprechaun! 
6. IGN is designed to create a nuclear balance and deprive the monopoly of some evil supporting groups. I don't mind your bombing them with IGN, but please **VOTE BY HAND**, and **DON'T spam irresponsibly with IGN** if you really intend to support me! Nobody gains real happiness through a nuclear war! If you really have to spam against the evil, think about all the factors carefully.  
7. ~~Vote **(by hand!)**~~ **Invest your billions of ¥, ￥, $, €, ￡,… in a 2nd season of anime** for Chtholly Nota Seniorious if you really love her!  
8. 有钱请捐给世萌，不要捐给代理ip供应商或者大厨。Donate your billions of dollars to ISML instead of proxy suppliers! Never buy a spamming service from rich supporting groups!  
  
Remember that: Nobody is with almighty justice. Nobody sees the end of war until death.  
  
Again: Thank you very much for fighting against all the bad sides in all kinds of saimoes!
